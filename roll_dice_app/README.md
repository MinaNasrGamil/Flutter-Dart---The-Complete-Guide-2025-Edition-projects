# roll_dice_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

I learn how to:

• Create a simple, interactive app that displays dice images
• Use Dart’s random number generation to simulate dice rolls
• Work with stateful widgets so that the UI updates every time you “roll” the dice
• Understand the fundamentals of Flutter’s widget tree and state management

This project is designed to give you a practical introduction to how Flutter apps are built—from setting up a project and using widgets to handling user input and updating the display dynamically. Many students find that building the Roll Dice App is a fun and accessible way to start understanding core Flutter concepts.
