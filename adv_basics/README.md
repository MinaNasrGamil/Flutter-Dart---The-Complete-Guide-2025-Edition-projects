# quiz app

From building the quiz app, I added several practical Flutter and Dart skills to my toolkit and resume, including:

Dynamic UI Building:
• Mapping data (lists of questions and answers) into Flutter widgets.
• Creating reusable, custom widgets to display quiz elements.

State Management:
• Using stateful widgets and the setState method to update the UI based on user interactions.
• Tracking user progress and scores throughout the quiz.

User Input Handling:
• Managing user taps and selections to register answers.
• Implementing feedback based on the correctness of answers.

Logic Implementation:
• Calculating scores based on user responses.
• Programming conditional logic to display a summary screen or reset the quiz.

App Flow and Navigation:
• Structuring a simple multi-screen application (e.g., moving from the quiz to a results page).
• Adding functionality to restart or reset the quiz.

Debugging and Testing:
• Running the app on an emulator, which helps in learning how to debug and refine the user interface.

Together, these skills provide a solid foundation in Flutter development—demonstrating your ability to build interactive, state-driven applications, which is highly valuable for both personal projects and professional roles in mobile app development.
